        <div class="text_about">
            <p>Sivasagar, previously spelled Sibsagar ("the ocean of Lord Shiva"), is a town in Upper Assam, about 360
                kilometers (224 mi) north east of Guwahati. It is the district headquarters of the Sivasagar district.
                It is well known for its Ahom palaces and monuments. Sivasagar today is also an important centre for the
                tea and oil industries.

                >Sivasagar, formerly known as Rangpur, was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom from 1699 to 1788. The Ahoms
                ruled Assam for six centuries, until their kingdom fell to the Burmese in 1819 and their ruling class
                was all but wiped out. The province was liberated by the British in 1825 but, owing to the state of
                anarchy which prevailed, it was completely annexed in 1826. For administrative purposes it was divided
                into three sub-divisions. It is said that the original name of Sivasagar was - 'Kalansupar' after the
                name of 'Kalansu Gohain' who resided in a village originally existed in the place where currently the
                Sivasagar tank is located. This town's main feature is the water body from which it takes its name. This
                is a 257-acre (1.04 km2) tank, also known as the Borpukhuri, which is at a higher elevation than the
                rest of the town, with three temples on its banks. Of these temples, the most prominent is the Sivadol,
                standing tall at 104 feet (32 m), drawing large crowds on Shiv Ratri. The other temples are the
                Vishnudol and Devidol. The Raj Kareng or royal palace and Talatal Ghar in Sivasagar complex standing
                magnificently near Joysagar tank bears the unfurled historical extravaganza unanimously. To its south
                stands the Fakua-Doul with eight symbols or octagonal in shape according to Taoist cosmology built by
                king Rudra Singha in 1703-04 A.D. for religious purpose, while the Ranghar known to be the first sports
                pavilion in Asia and built in its present shape by king Pramatta Singha in 1746 A.D., still proudly
                stands on the west. Out of the five capital towns of the Ahom rule, as many as four, Charaideo, Saragua,
                Gargaon and Rangpur, were within Sivasagar district leaving only Jorhat the last one in the adjacent
                district by the same name.

                >Earlier the Sivasagar town was bounded by Cherekapar on the east, Kathpar on the west, Joyrapar in the
                north and Dhuliapar on the south. Till the fag end of the Ahom rule the name Shivpur persisted. Only
                after the treaty of Yandaboo in 1826 A.D. when the East India Company and for that matter, the British
                government came to hold power, Shivpur along with Rangpur came to be known as Sibsagar. During the
                British rule, the Sibsagar district comprised three sub-divisions: Sibsagar, Jorhat and Golaghat. In
                1912 A.D. the district headquarter was again shifted to Jorhat leaving Sibsagar only as a sub-divisional
                headquarter. It remained so till 1983 when on 1 July that year the Sibsagar and Golaghat sub-division of
                undivided Sibsagar district were declared as new districts by the Government of Assam. The newly
                constituted Sibsagar district has three sub-divisions, viz. Sibsagar, Nazira and Charaideo.

                        Sivasagar town. The name translates to 'House of Entertainment' and dates back to 1746 A.D. when
                        the Ahoms used to rule present-day Assam. This monument is an important edifice reflecting the
                        architectural precision and grandeur of that time.
